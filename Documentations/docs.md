The 13th century Afghan-born Jalaluddin Rumi (1207â€“1273) is one of the best-selling poets today in the West. His lofty, feel-good verses on the power and virtues of 'love' are embraced by many for their poignancy and inspiration. But as Idries Shah tells us in his comprehensive chapter about Rumi in The Sufis, the Afghan's poetry contains depths of meaning not often understood, or even appreciated. Rumi was also more than just a poet. He worked towards a specific, actionable purpose, Shah says, that went far beyond the emotional value associated with his writing.
